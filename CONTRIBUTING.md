# Opening an Issue

Please feel free to open an issue for any reason, including but not limited to bugs, feature requests, and help.  
If the issue is a duplicate, it will be flagged as such and subsequently closed by the Felony team.  
If not, expect some serious discussion!
If you're reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible about your environment and the steps leading up to it.  A good bug report is usually one that has enough information for the developers to replicate the bug.
